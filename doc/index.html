        <strong>What are luminosity masks?</strong>
        <p>
          Luminosity masks are a way to control images based on its tones. Confused? 
          See this <a target="_blank" href="http://goodlight.us/writing/luminositymasks/luminositymasks-1.html">excellent article by Tony Kuyper</a>.      
          This script is based on his great work.          
        </p>
      </li>

        <strong>How to install this script?</strong>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you want to try this script just once open Photoshop and go to <i>File->Scripts->Browse...</i><br/>
              Choose the file <i>Marc Sàbat Luminosity Masks.jsx</i>.
              <p>(Restart Photoshop if needed)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to install it permanently and be easy accessible just copy the file <i>Marc Sàbat Luminosity Masks.jsx</i> to the scripts folder.<br/>
              Usually: <i>c:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC (64 Bit)\Presets\Scripts\</i>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>

        <strong>How does it work?</strong>
        <p>
          Upon firing the script a dialog will be presented:          
        </p>
        <center>
          <img src="img/LuminosityMasks-Dialog.png" alt="Luminosity masks dialog"></img>
        </center>

        <p>Here you can choose how many depth levels of luminosity masks will be created and wheter or not curves adjustment layers will be created based on luminosity masks channels.</p>
        
        <p>Once the script has finished you will find the new luminosity channels:</p>
        <center>
          <img src="img/LuminosityMasks-Channels.png" alt="Luminosity masks channels"></img>
        </center>

        <p>You can load any channel as a selection (using the corresponding button at the bottom of channels tab) and, then, create any adjustment layer. The new adjustment layer will have attached the selected luminosity mask.</p>
        <p>If you decided to create curves adjustment layers you will find three different sets (Darks, Lights and Midtones). Each set will contain as many adjustment layers as the depth specified.</p>

        </center>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Why did you create this script?</strong>
        <p>
          Multiple reasons: 
            <ul>
              <li>I did not find a free script or action <i>easily</i> downloadable (by that I mean no registration or giving away eMail address).</li>
              <li>Some actions I found had issues with different UI languages (i.e. did not work for Photoshop installations different than the language they were created in).</li>
              <li>I wanted some control like how many luminosity masks are going to be created and be able to create curves adjustment layers automatically.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      
    </ul>
